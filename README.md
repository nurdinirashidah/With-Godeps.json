#### Vulnerable Call Chain
This project does not have a vulnerable call chain. If you would like to test this feature, feel free to create a vulnerable call chain by modifying `main.go` and send us a PR.

#### What's next?
By running the security scanner of your choice against `godep-basic` project, you should get results that are coherent with the details above if the tool supports scanning Golang projects using Godep as their package manager.
